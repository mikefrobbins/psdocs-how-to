![What is Markdown?][04]

"Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor.
John Gruber created Markdown in 2004 as a markup language that is appealing to human readers in its
source code form. Markdown is widely used in blogging, instant messaging, online forums,
collaborative software, documentation pages, and readme files.

The initial description of Markdown contained ambiguities and raised unanswered questions, causing
implementations to both intentionally and accidentally diverge from the original version. This was
addressed in 2014, when long-standing Markdown contributors released CommonMark, an unambiguous
specification and test suite for Markdown." -- source: [Wikipedia][03]
