![Formatting][06]

Markdown includes several ways to format text. The most common are:

```markdown
- This text is **bold**.
- This text is _italic_.
- This text is both **_bold and italic_**.
- This is an inline `code` span.
```

These examples render as:

- This text is **bold**.
- This text is _italic_.
- This text is both **_bold and italic_**.
- This is an inline `code` span.

The PowerShell-Docs Style Guide has recommendations for how to use formatting in your documentation.
