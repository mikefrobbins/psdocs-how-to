![What is Hugo?][01]

Hugo, often referred to as "GoHugo" because of its foundation in the Go programming language, is a
popular static site generator. Static site generators are tools that take in content, typically
written in lightweight markup languages like Markdown, and produce static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
files. These static files can then be served by any web server without the need for a database or
backend processing.

Here are some features and characteristics of Hugo:

- **Speed**: One of Hugo's major selling points is its speed. It can generate thousands of pages in
  a matter of seconds.

- **Single Binary**: Being written in Go, Hugo is distributed as a single binary, making it easy to
  install and run without dependencies.

- **Flexible**: Hugo supports custom themes, shortcodes, and a variety of content structures,
  allowing users to create unique websites tailored to their needs.

- **Live Reload**: Hugo includes its own web server, which can be used for local development. This
  server can "live reload" your site as you make changes, updating the browser instantly.

- **Data Driven Content**: While primarily used for content written in Markdown, Hugo also has the
  ability to pull in data from external sources in formats like JSON or CSV, and use that data to
  generate content.

- **Rich Content**: With its built-in templating, Hugo can handle a variety of content types,
  including blog posts, pages, e-commerce products, etc.

- **Taxonomies**: Hugo supports taxonomies like tags and categories out of the box, allowing for
  rich content organization and navigation.

- **Extensible**: While Hugo's core is intentionally kept simple, it's designed to be extensible
  with themes and plugins, making it suitable for a wide range of projects from blogs to
  documentation sites and more.

- **Community**: Hugo has a large and active community that contributes to its development, provides
  support, and creates themes and plugins.

If you're considering creating a static website or moving away from a dynamic CMS, Hugo is a strong
contender to consider, especially if you prioritize speed and ease of use.
