![Publish to GitHub pages][01]

GitHub provides free static hosting from a GitHub repo via its GitHub Pages service and automated
development workflows with GitHub Actions. This makes it easy to publish your Hugo site to GitHub.

For a walkthrough of how to set up GitHub Pages for your Hugo site, see the
[Hugo documentation for Hosting on GitHub Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/).
