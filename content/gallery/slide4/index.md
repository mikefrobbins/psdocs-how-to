For security, a newly created key value is never shown on the screen and is only available with the
**Copy** button, as shown below.

Copy the key and store is somewhere safe. You need it to publish your module.

> You can only copy the API key value immediately after creating or refreshing it. It will not be
> displayed. It will not be accessible after the page is refreshed. If you lose the key value, you
> must use **Regenerate**, and copy the key after it's regenerated.
